I was Principal Engineer of Intel Corporation until May 31, 2018.
I was one of co-founders of Olaworks, inc., a computer vision start-up company that was acquired by Intel in 2012. After that I developed computer vision algorithms for intel platform and contributed small AI accelerator design.

# Background Job I did (not directly from my primary job)
Last autum and winter (Nov 2017 - Jan 2018), I worked with my ex-colleague, [Sang Il Park](http://dasan.sejong.ac.kr/~sipark/), to solve a problem of playing with halftone images such as descreening their halftone patterns, editing their contents, and chaning their halftone styles:
